  "readme": "# apostrophe-people\n\n`apostrophe-people` adds staff directories, user accounts and user profiles to the [Apostrophe](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe) content management system. `apostrophe-people` provides both backend and frontend components, including a friendly UI built on Apostrophe's rich content editing features.\n\nA \"person\" is anyone who can either log in, be seen in a personnel directory, or both. \"Users\" are simply people who have the \"login\" box checked and a username and password configured. This follows the MongoDB philosophy of avoiding gratuitous joins between users, profiles, etc.\n\nPeople can be centrally managed via the \"People\" dropdown. In addition, one can create a \"people page\" to display a directory of people. For now people are displayed on such pages based on shared tags, however we plan to also give each user an affinity for a specific \"home\" page allowing for easier management of users.\n",
